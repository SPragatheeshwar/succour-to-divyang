This is a project that focuses mainly on independent life style of the visually impaired people. 
It's been really difficult for them to walk on the streets independently because they don't know what is the obstacle is there in front of them.

This project helps them to identify the obstacles in front of them and tell the distance in which it is located. So that the user(visually imparied people) can
get a clear idea on the obstacle and dodge them.
They'll be intimated about the obstacle via voice commands.

flow of execution (user part):
(i) The user starts the applicaion and clicks a button in his bluetooth that will trigger the personal AI assistant that we've developed which will do
almost all the work.
(ii) Right now it's job is limited, so the user can use this assistant to open the object detection model to detect the obstacled in front of him.
(iii) To prevent latency and improve the performance web technologies have been implemented which will send 2 frames per second.
(iv) User can also navigate himself to the nearby shop using the personal AI assistant, where we have used google API which will the directions and our system tells
them about the obstacles.

(user's relative or caretaker part):
(i) The user's relative or caretaker can view the live locaion of the user and moniter him.
(ii) The user's relative will be able to send a message to the user.
(iii) The user's relative will be able to view the user's travel history.
